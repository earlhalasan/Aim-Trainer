# Aim Trainer

## Concept
Want to improve your aim on first person shooters? Or just open files laying around your desktop with heightened precision and speed? Then Aim Trainer is the game for you. Click the target on the screen and a new target will appear. You have 20 seconds to click as many targets as possible before the game ends. If you can hit 15 targets before time’s up, you’ve won—but if you’ve gotten 15, increase your high score! I have always loved FPS games so it made sense to make a game that would help improve the aiming mechanic.

## Tasks I still need to complete
I plan on building this game out using canvas with click event listeners. It will generate a target (circle or target.png) which the player has to click in order to generate a new one. I plan on using a 130ms buffer until the next target appears. Average human reaction times range from 250ms-270ms, but since higher tiered players will have reaction times from 160ms-200ms. Going to include a score tally as well within the 20s timeframe and I'm using 20s just because (for now) it seems like an approriate, not too long and not too short, time to hold a game like this. I also hope to implement different difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, and Nightmare.  
  
* **Normal:** One sized target that will generate randomly after each successful click.  
* **Hard:** Smaller targets that will generate randomly after each succesful click.  
* **Nightmare:** Smaller AND moving targets. Two clicks will be required to make moving targets disappear.  

Planning to include menu and game play music, sound effects on successful clicks, and top score display.

Drew this out using Figjam. Hoping to go with a flat design for the game similar to what's shown above.
